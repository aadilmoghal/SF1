# Introduction

To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.


# Technology 

The technologies I will be using to create my CRUD application are: 

    Kanban Board: Jira

    Database: GCP Managed SQL Server

    Programming Language: Java

    Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

    Unit Tests: JUnit and Mockito

    Version Control: Git

    Cloud Server: GCP Virtual Machine



# Scope

    A Jira board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.

    Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for your project.

    A detailed Risk Assessment created at the beginning of your project.

    A relational database used to store data persistently for the project.

    A functional application created in the OOP language, following best practices and design principles, which you have covered during training, this application needs to meet the requirements set on your Kanban Board

    The application must have a functioning front-end website and integrated API.

    Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application.

    You must meet an acceptable level of test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence that you have done so.

    Code fully integrated into a Version Control System

    Code built through a CI server

    Application deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

# General Approach

My approach is to create a food basket that allows users to insert the name of their favourite food to their basket and find out how much the total of the entire basket will be. The application will allow users to add delete and edit their basket if they decide to change a few items.

# ERD
Below is a Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the structure of the database. The reason why it is in green is because it has been implemented into my project

# Project Tracking

Jira was used to track the progress on my work and it was designed as a Agile Scrum Board.

The board has been designed in order for users to make posts of tasks needed for completion. The board allows users to move tasks from left to right from 'To do' to 'Completion'.

# Front End



# Testing
Testing was done by using JUnit for integration testing and Mockito for unit testing, as seen below.

The integration testing used HTTP requests to mock the repo created to see if there would be a response. The request was handled by the controlled and passed through the service. 

Mockito testing was used to make a fake repo that is not really accessible. It allows us to see if various methods work well together with each other.

# Risk Assessment

The risk assessment of the project can be below

# Improvements

what could have done

better interface with better colours

nav bar could be included to help navigation


# Bibliography

I would like to thank and acknoledge the QA Trainers and my frinds that helped my with obsetcles i came accross during the development of this application
